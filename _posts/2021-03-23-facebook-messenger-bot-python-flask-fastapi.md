Assume that you have signed up for a Facebook developer account and created a new app set up for messenger, now it is time to build codes for receiving, processing, and sending messages.

To be able to do all these, you will first need to set up a basic webhook to pass facebook messengerâ€™s required webhook verification step. This guide will show you how to do it with python FastAPI and set up a framework for expanding your messenger bot for later.

## Create a new python FastAPI project

FastAPI is a modern and popular python framework for building APIs. FastAPI is very similar to Flask, another popular framework for python. One should be able to move a simple Flask app to FastAPI in seconds. However, FastAPI may be much faster than Flask because it is built over ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface). It is very easy to write asynchronous code with FastAPI whereas with Flask you will probably need help from additional tools such as Celery.

To get started with FastAPI, install fastapi and unicorn via pip:


```bash
pip install fastapi
pip install uvicorn
```

Now create "app.py" file and set up the FastAPI app.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Response

# setup FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()
```

Below that we add a /webhook endpoint to accept GET requests. This will be where we handle the required webhook verification step.

```python
# receive messages Facebook sends to our webhook
@app.get('/webhook')
def init_messenger(request: Request):
	# TODO: complete this method
	pass
```

Next, we can define how our app will run with uvicorn. Here I set "log_config=None" so that I can use python's logging module as usual. Alternatively, you can configure your own uvicorn's LOGGING_CONFIG.


```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run("app:app", log_config=None, debug=True, reload=True)
```

This is all we need for now for a backbone FastAPI app and we will complete our /webhook endpoint in the next section. 

## Add support for GET requests to our webhook

For the required webhook verification step, we will need to create a "verify token". This verify token is just a random string that you make up. You need to then provide the verify token both to the Facebook Messenger Platform and to your FastAPI app. 

Since the verify token is sensitive, it is not a good idea to hardcode it into the webhook in "app.py". Instead we create a ".env" file to manage it. 


```bash
FB_VERIFY_TOKEN=<YOUR_VERIFY_TOKEN>
```

We will use dotenv to retrieve the verify token we saved in .env file. 


```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

In "app.py" we get our verify token as an environment variable. 

```python
# use dotenv to handle .env
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# get environment variables
VERIFY_TOKEN = os.getenv('FB_VERIFY_TOKEN')
```

When the Facebook Messenger Platform sends a GET request to our webhook, we can find the token in the hub.verify_token parameter of the query string. At our endpoint, we simply check if the verify token sent by Facebook is the same as the one we know. 

```python
@app.get('/webhook')
def init_messenger(request: Request):
	# FB sends the verify token as hub.verify_token
    fb_token = request.query_params.get("hub.verify_token")

    # we verify if the token sent matches our verify token
    if fb_token == VERIFY_TOKEN:
    	# respond with hub.challenge parameter from the request.
        return Response(content=request.query_params["hub.challenge"])
    return 'Failed to verify token'
```

After successful verification, the Messenger Platform will subscribe our webhook to the messenger.

## Test our webhook with ngrok

Now we can run our FastAPI app locally. To test it with the Facebook Messenger Platform, we need a secure URL to our localhost server and we can get it using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). 

Once ngrok is set up, we run our FastAPI app locally and in the terminal run the following command. "8000" because it is usually the default port for FastAPI app.

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

This will give us an instant URL, this URL is dynamic and will change every time we run ngrok again. You will see something like this in your terminal:

```bash
ngrok by @inconshreveable                                 (Ctrl+C to quit)
                                                                                       
Session Status                online                                             
Account                       xxxx.xxxxxxx@xxx.com (Plan: Free)                         
Version                       2.3.35                                                   
Region                        United States (us)                                       
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040                                    
Forwarding                    http://f3b4c20292d3.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000    
Forwarding                    https://f3b4c20292d3.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000   
                                                                                       
Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90              
                              1       0       0.00    0.00    5.02    5.02             
```

Make sure to copy the "https" address and go to your app on the Facebook Developer Platform. You should be able to find the "Settings" page for "Messenger" and the "Webhook" section. Now you can "Edit Callback URL". 

The callback URL will be the https address copied from ngrok and the "/webhook" endpoint. The verify token needs to be the same as the string we put in the ".env" file. 

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![FB verify token]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/fb_verify_token.png){:height="75%" width="75%"}
{: refdef}

When you click on "Verify and save" and no error is shown, that means you successfully completed the webhook verification ðŸŽ‰. You should also see that the GET request at our /webhook got a 200 OK in the terminal running ngrok. 


```bash
HTTP Requests                                                                          
-------------                                                                          
                                                                                       
GET /webhook                   200 OK   
```


## Next steps

Setting up the webhook is a huge step for writing a Facebook Messenger bot. The more exciting step, however, is to be able to receive messages from users and reply to their messages. There are multiple ways to do it in python. Another post for another time.
